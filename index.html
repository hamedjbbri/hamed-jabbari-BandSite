        <h4>Xavier de Rosnay & Gaspard Augé</h4>

        <div class="sections">Xavier De Ronsay and Gaspard Augé had a few mutual friends,
            who happened to run a record label, seeking tracks for a
            compilation. With an immediate connection, the pair decided to
            try their hand at making a song. That’s when they created their
            breakout single, We Are Your Friends – a feel-good, funk-filled,
            instant anthem that lost the remix contest, but won the attention
            of Pedro Winter, director of the newly founded Ed Banger
            Records, who boasted Daft Punk as former clients. One week
            later, they were in his office, signing a record deal</div>
